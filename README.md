# SWFRun3

Just where I store my Run 3 SWF files to import in Ruffle

If you'd like a guide on how to do such yourself:

-Download either SWF. I have only tested 'Run 3.swf' so i am unsure if 'Run3' is any different.

-Go to Ruffle and hit 'Demo.' Then, import your sfw.

Now, it should work in browser and on any operating system :)
